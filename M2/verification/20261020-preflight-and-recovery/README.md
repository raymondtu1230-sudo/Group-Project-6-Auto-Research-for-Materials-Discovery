# M2 continuation evidence — 20 October 2026

## Latest continuation — 20 October 2026, Singapore time

This section supersedes the older retry-only authorization and stopped-monitor
wording below. The user explicitly authorized completion of the missing 34 dev
baseline units. Preserve the already accepted Mg-Sn-Sr/17 pair and all failed
attempts. Main changes remain under M2; M1 integration and freeze stay with M1.

- Accepted scientific baseline coverage remains **2/36**, with 17 Random and
  17 Chemeleon units still unaccepted. No new scientific score is claimed.
- Previous Random workflow 39284865198 stopped in prepare at Ruff import
  sorting before any scientific unit was scheduled. Source CIs 39284459462,
  39284865097 and 39285316822 also stopped at all-M2 Ruff; their skipped smoke
  steps are not passes. Full raw job logs are retained in
  [the continuation audit](verification/20261020-preflight-and-recovery/README.md).
- The two test-import blocks were corrected under MADE's Ruff configuration.
  Revision `b3f68f274373d4599a7e026cd0f3cf5a9889e977` starts
  [missing-only Random run 39286848821](https://github.com/raymondtu1230-sudo/Group-Project-6-Auto-Research-for-Materials-Discovery/actions/runs/39286848821).
  Its prepare job has now passed the current checks including official smoke,
  and retained-evidence validation. The 17-unit matrix is now released;
  2 Random jobs are running and 15 are queued at this observation. Its matrix admits only missing Random
  units, at most four concurrently; an existing completed pair is never rerun.
- Actual small-model recovery run
  [39285316913](https://github.com/raymondtu1230-sudo/Group-Project-6-Auto-Research-for-Materials-Discovery/actions/runs/39285316913)
  passed its continuous/interrupted/cross-process checks with two Li2O candidates,
  batch=1 and unchanged 256 diffusion steps. Artifact 12201404998 has GitHub
  digest `8570dbc27d6a286c60a994ccb4d704169ef4f0c58247c9a0c926ff88a65eace9`.
  This turn inspected raw logs and artifact metadata, but has not independently
  downloaded and rehashed this non-scoring artifact.
- [Batch256 cross-runner run 39286986254](https://github.com/raymondtu1230-sudo/Group-Project-6-Auto-Research-for-Materials-Discovery/actions/runs/39286986254)
  is submitted at fixed source `e30b5bb233842797f4ad90c80732bb327d07c0bf`.
  Its two sampling jobs were queued at last inspection. It uses a 512-candidate
  Li2O validation fixture, two original batch=256 calls, an uploaded checkpoint
  and restoration on a separate runner. It requires exact structures, RNG,
  preserved first-batch bytes and distinct runner hostnames. This is **not a
  benchmark result or proof of full protocol-pool compatibility**. No formal
  Chemeleon unit has been scheduled using this experimental cache.
- Fresh isolated local checks: 17 M1 tests and 53 M2 tests passed, no skips in
  this host invocation; focused and complete M2 Ruff passed. Local official
  smoke reached Chrome export but stalled and was terminated as an incomplete
  synthetic check. The earlier local CPU-namespace skip and Chrome socket
  failure remain historical records, not passes. Current GitHub gate is the
  source of truth for hosted smoke.
- Current-source CI [39286986328](https://github.com/raymondtu1230-sudo/Group-Project-6-Auto-Research-for-Materials-Discovery/actions/runs/39286986328)
  at `e30b5bb` now passed all gates, including reproducible installation,
  original M1 tests, all M2 tests, both Ruff checks and unchanged official smoke.
  CI 39286848820 was still pending at its earlier inspection.
- Keep the M2 development branch and draft PR #2. Do not merge, delete branches,
  change official parameters, or edit the old retry-request.json. Routing-off
  still depends on M1's frozen full-method reference; M6 owns check/hidden tests.


The JSON status is an observation, not a final sweep result. The GitHub links show subsequent changes. Failed prepare jobs did not spend scientific queries. Existing pair archives remain unchanged in their original folders. Exact raw job logs below preserve the failures and small-model recovery check. No hardware or interrupted-attempt cost is fabricated; unmeasured totals remain null.

Main advanced concurrently to `2138100e876e3c57c295cd7fc09c3c5614a569ce` while this audit was being published. That newer M2 prototype, report and slide files were preserved. This publication only appends status and audit evidence; it does not overwrite those newer canonical sources. The exact recovery checker/cache and cross-runner workflow used by run 39286986254 are preserved in this folder and pinned to e30b5bb. A prepared second batch-scale request on main was not dispatched by this turn, to avoid duplicating this validation.
